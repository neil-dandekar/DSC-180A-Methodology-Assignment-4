**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
This quarter I've learned about both LLM jailbreaking and mechanistic interpretability. Both have been fascinating to learn about and how impactful they are, but my partner and I are pursuing mechanistic interpretability for our capstone's project.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
I want to investigate ways to improve interpretable models for text generation tasks since it's relatively unexplored.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
One change I'd make is improving my programming skills in deep learning before beginning my Quarter 2 project.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I'd like to try using different foundation models or different supervised fine-tuning algorithms to train the models.
